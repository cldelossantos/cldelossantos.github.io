   Hello! My name is Claudia De Los Santos. I am a senior research assistant at Weill Cornell Medicine at the Center for Research on End-of-Life. I work closely with a principal investigator on three research studies that focus on decisions made by people at their end of life. I work with data and therefore am interested in becoming a TKH Innovation Fellow.

   A little background about me. I was born in Peru and came to the United States when I was five years old. I have always lived in the Bronx and can't imagine living anywhere else. I have worked since I was 16 and worked throughout college while holding a full time job. Work ethic is a value I hold highly and put into practice towards anything I commit to. I hold a bachelor's in Biology, but in the last two years began shifting my career towards research.

   TKH is a great opportunity for minorities like myself. I think programs like the TKH Fellowship can help reduce disparities within low income communities as well as uplift and motivate many to pursue careers in which we are currently underepresented.
